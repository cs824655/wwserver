# wwserver

## Overview

This is the backend server for the werewolf board game. The goal of this app is to replace the God/Judge role so that every one can join the game. One user needs to create a game and other users need to join the game using the game number that is randomly generated by the app. Users also need to provide their seat number and their roles. This app will then guide the users to complete the game and automatically decide which team wins.

## Version

### Latest: 1.0.0 (Beta)

This version only support the most basic composition: 9 players in total, 3 werewolves, 3 gods (seer, witch, hunter) and 3 villagers. Users can choose to play kill-side or kill-all mode.
